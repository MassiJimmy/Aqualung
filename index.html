                    <p>
                        Swim goggles are the most essential piece of equipement in your swim gear bag to ensure
                        a successful swim session. But some factors can negatively  impact their lifespan. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, chlorine, sweat, sunscreen and makeup can damage the lens and gasket 
                        impacting your vision, the fit and creating fog. In our swim goggles care guide, we will give
                        you all the tips to allow your swimming goggles to perform better and last longer.

                        WHY ARE YOUR<br> 
                        GOGGLES FOGGING?

                    <p>
                        Fog is a common challenge for all swimmers. It's the 
                        result of condensation. Your swim goggles cool down 
                        in the water, while the area around your eyes heats 
                        up due to rising body temperature stimulated by the 
                        effort. This unbalance causes water droplets to form 
                        on the inside of your goggles, which creates fog.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All our swimming goggles feature a hydrophilic anti-fog
                        treatment with ingredients absorbing moisture.
                        It allows to attract the vapor droplet and spread them 
                        into a thin layer spread over the surface for a greater 
                        visibility while swimming
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        while all our swimming goggles feature anti-fog 
                        treatment, it can still be damaged by lack of caring, 
                        wear and tear.

                    Avoid having water already
